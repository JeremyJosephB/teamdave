# teamdave
This is the repo for one of my personal project [webpages](http://hashtagteamdave.com)

### Why did I choose the Team Dave name?

Dave was the lead dev of a programming team for attaqonline.com, which I was a BETA tester of. I bought the URL as an inside joke, but as I started to develop, it began to stick, so now I like to brand my repos as an offshoot of Team Dave. This page was #TeamDave, or ` hashtag ` Team Dave, thus the name.

### Why make this REPO?

The files contained herein are from mostly juvinile years of learning code and dabbling. I just opted to put some code, however poorly formatted it may be, onto GitHub to track my learning, add functionality, and create a testing grounds for FTP, DB Interfacing, and other dev-related skills. This code was all written from a terminal under version control, pushed to GitHub, and uploaded via FTP to the web server sedrving under the above URL.

This is being made public in hopes potentional employers or developers see my code and wish to interview me or ask me questions.

### How can I help?

I may at times have projects listed that I'm struggling to solve (at the time of writing, I don't know what those may be) but check the "Projects" tab, find something you'd like to add, and feel free to push the code. I'll check it, and if it seems like a positive feature, or something I can work on for a solution, I'll gladly merge. Feel free to comment your code to credit yourself as the author, if you're into that sort of thing.
